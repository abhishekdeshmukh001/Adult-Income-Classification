## Title: Adult Income Classification

### A. Description:
This project focuses on the classification of individuals' income levels, aiming to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year. It utilizes various classification algorithms and evaluates their performance using confusion matrices and classification reports.

### B. Dataset Description: 
The dataset contains various attributes such as age, workclass, education, occupation, native country, etc.
We will be using the following dataset:

      adult.csv

### C. Classification Algorithms Implemented:
The following classification algorithms were implemented in this project:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
* **Decision Tree**
* **Random Forest**
* **Gaussian Naive Bayes**
* **Bernoulli Naive Bayes**
* **AdaBoost**
* **Gradient Boost**

## -Tasks Performed:

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
* Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, if any.
* Explored the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and distribution of features.
* Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

### 2. Model Implementation:
* Implemented the classification algorithms listed above using appropriate libraries or frameworks.

### 3. Model Evaluation:
For each algorithm, performed the following:
* Fit the model to the training data.
* Made predictions on the test data.
* Created a confusion matrix to assess model performance.
* Visualized the confusion matrix to provide an intuitive representation of results.
* Generated classification reports to get a detailed overview of the model's accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and support.

### 4. Visualizations:
* Created confusion matrix visualizations for each classification algorithm to demonstrate model performance.
* These visualizations provide a clear understanding of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
